I'm Paul Hobson — a technology leader with a background in platform strategy and organisational design.

I've spent my career at the intersection of engineering, product, and the organisational structures that make (or prevent) good work from happening. I'm interested in how teams build leverage, how platforms create and destroy value, and what it actually takes to change how a large institution operates.

This site is where I write and document work. It's a mix of long-form thinking, project notes, and occasional technical writing.

## Background

Platform strategy. Organisational design. Engineering leadership. I've worked on complex systems where the technical and the organisational problems are inseparable.
